# Reliable Data Transfer - Implemented with UDP



To run the program, the UDP_Common.py file must be in the same directory as UDP_Client.py and UDP_Server.py.

If a different loopback address is used it can be changed at the top of both UDP_Client.py and UDP_Server.py. The port number used can also be changed here. 

No additional arguments or variables are required.


**Usage:**
~~~~
python3 UDP_Server.py
python3 UDP_Client.py
~~~~
